        <h3 class="maas-help-main">What is metrics-as-a-service App?</h3>
        <div class="maas-help-detail">
            <p>metrics-as-a-service App (MAAS App) is a highly configurable app that speeds up implementation of
                consistent,
                professional, and proven metrics for your IT projects.</p>

            <p>The App is based on years of experience of successfully delivering many types of projects, some $100m in
                size.
                The principles learnt from this experience is embedded in the App thereby significantly improving the
                chances of
                successful delivery.</p>

            <p>The App is highly configurable; the first outputs are available in minutes. The tool does not any require
                specialist (such as Power BI) skills. It allows the data held in the collaborative tools (such as Jira,
                DevOps,
                Service Now, and HP/QC) to be the single source of truth. All stakeholders from execs to PMs to
                developers/testers use same data to make decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="maas-help-main">How to use the App?</h3>
        <div class="maas-help-detail">
            <!-- <p>Click on the load button (top menu) and point to a file with comma separated values (csv). The metrics
                will
                automatically load up creating one chart for each value. As simple as that.</p>
            <p>You can click on the charts that automatically filters (aka slices and dices) the data.</p>
            <p>You can produce a PDF file for the charts by clicking on the load button (top menu)</p>
            <p>You can then configure the default charts as described in the section below.</p> -->
            <p>In the main menu on the top it shows the following options: load data, modify layout, copy config, paste
                config, print PDF, help and feedback.</p>
            <p>Load data allows you to load fresh data. When data is loaded first time there is “config” created
                automatically. You can modify these configs as described in x. Therefore when new data is loaded if a
                config already exists the app asks you if existing config should be used for the new file or should the
                config be recreated or if the load itself be aborted. The input data is expected as a css (comma
                separated value) file. The App expects the date fields to be DD-MMM-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD. This is to avoid
                misinterpreting American and European date formats.</p>
            <p>Modify layout lets you update the chart title of the “data as of date”. This is the”report date” which is
                used in other charts (W4, Trend and Trend OC)</p>
            <p>Copy Main Config is basically it it copies the config that that is stored in the app at that point. The
                idea is that you copy the conflict and keep it safe for future use.</p>
            <p>Paste Main Config allows you to paste (a previously saved) config. In this manner you can save time when
                configuring charts when the underlaying data is refreshed.</p>
            <p>Print PDF. As the name suggests it creates a PDF version of the metrics.</p>
            <p>Help takes you this document</p>
            <p>Feedback lets you to send an email with your comments. </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="maas-help-main"> </h3>
        <div class="maas-help-detail">
            <p>On the top-right of each chart there is a hamburger menu. If you click on this the App will offer you
                following options: filter, config, remove, clone or close. </p>
            <p>Filter chart shows all the values in the X axis where you can select the values that you want filter
                (check to show and no check to hide)>. Note this option is only shown for the charts that are
                filterable.</p>
            <p>Config charts gives you the option to change the chart as you see fit. This is described in detail in a
                separate section.</p>
            <p>Remove chart deletes the chart. The app asks for a confirmation from you before deleting chart</p>
            <p>Clone chart lets you add copy of the chart at the current position. Once copied you can change the
                config.</p>
            <p>Close closes the dialogue.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="maas-help-main">How to configue charts?</h3>
        <div class="maas-help-detail">
            <p>
                Config charts gives you the option to change the chart as you see fit. When new data is loaded the App
                creates a config automatically based on the data form the first row </p>
                <p>There are some common values for all charts; these are: chart title, whether the title should be
                automatically set, by the App chart size, chart position and chart type.</p>
                <p>It is recommended that you keep auto title checked while you are configuring the charts. Once you are done configuring the
                charts you can uncheck the “auto-title” and type your value.</p>
                    <p>Chart size can be small, medium or large. On larger screens, such as PC or laptop, the three types will
                show appropriately. On a smaller screen, such as mobile, all charts will show in one size.</p>
                <p>Chart position lets you change the position of the chart. Just sleet a position and the App move that
                particular chart to the desired position</p>
                <p>Chart type can be as follows: 2X2, Data Table, Date, List, Note, Number, Plan, Risk, State Change, String, Trend, and Trend OC. 
                When you select the chart type different options, relevant to the selected type, are available for you
                to configure.</p>

            <p>2x2 shows the cross tabulated data for two columns. You can select the x and y columns. The App
                highlights the low and high values.</p>

            <p>Data table is basically a list of the rows of the input data. You can select the number of rows to
                display. There is an option to count the rows or use another column, called column over, with numeric
                data and the App will either display the sum or average of the values form this second column.</p>

            <p>Date is used when the x-axis has date vale. Choose the data table chart type date means the X axis
                estate at the column column ID. You can select the column to show in the x-axis. Different formats
                available such as DD is the day of the month, DDD is day of the week, MMM is month, MMM-YY is specific
                month and W4 shows the data in weeks to either side of the report date.</p>

            <p>List applies to a column that contains a list of values, for example list of tags in Azure DevOps or
                list of linked defects to a test script. You have to indicate a separator for the list, such as comma.
                The separator defaults to a space if not provided.</p>

            <p>Note allows to specify a message in the metrics. It is not really a chart but useful in embedding key
                messages in the metrics. The demos make use of these Notes to describe the metrics.</p>

            <p>Number is used when the x-axis has numbers. There is an option for youth enter “bin” to show chart by
                bin values. The bin if entered must be a comma separated list of numbers in ascending order. There is an
                option to count the rows or use another column, called column over, with numeric data and the App will
                either display the sum or average of the values form this second column.</p>

            <p>Plan shows the data in a Gantt chart The inputs required are column that has the description to show in
                the plan, cowman for start date and column for the end date. Clearly columns for start and end dates
                must contain dates.</p>

            <p>Risk shows the data in standard 5x5 risk matrix. You can select the likelihood and impact columns. The
                App will expect the values 1 to 5 in these columns. You can define define the likelihood and impact
                values as well. There is an option to count the rows or use another column, called column over, with
                numeric data and the App will either display the sum or average of the values form this second column.
            </p>

            <p>State change is it a chart that shows data on transitions. It expects that the data source is sorted in
                acceding oder for each item. You have to select thee columns from where the App picks the values: Time
                stamp shows the time of the transition while From and To give the values at the point of transition.
                There is an option to count the number of transition or calculate the total time of transition or
                average time for transition.</p>

            <p>String is a is used when the x-axis is neither Date or Number. You can define an “order” that will make
                sure (a) the x-axis will be ordered accordingly (b) the item will be shown on the chart even if the
                value is zero. For instance, you want to show P1 even if zero then enter P1 in “order”. There is an
                option to count the rows or use another column, called column over, with numeric data and the App will
                either display the sum or average of the values form this second column.</p>

            <p>Trend shows trend of values; for example test execution trend. You have to specify a date column. You
                can further define “count if“ values in another column (“count if coulum) that are used to calculate the
                trend. If “count if” values are not provided that to defined exact date: and then you can select another
                column where you can specify the values to be counted. There are further options to define a forecast
                and plan.</p>


            <p>Trend OC is very similar to Trend except it calculated the trend using ‘open’ and ‘close’ dates.</p>
